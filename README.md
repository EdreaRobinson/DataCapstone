## Ideas and MVP for my Bright Paths - Data Solutions Capstone Project

1 - What were the most popular baby names in each state and/or region for the past 10 years?  How do they compare to the national popularity of those names?

2 - Are names more popular in certain regions than others?

3 - Tech Stack:
    - Python
    - Pandas - read data into Python and EDA
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn - Visualization of name data
    - Plotly - Interactive dashboard

4 - Data Sources
    - Baby Names from Social Security Card Applications - State and District of Columbia Data 
    - Baby Names from Social Security Card Applications - National Data
    - https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
    
5 - Acceptance criteria
    - As a user, I should be able to see the most popular names for each state
